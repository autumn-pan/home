Hi, I'm Autumn, an amateur mathematician and programmer working on embedded systems and theoretical computer science.

First proposed by Tibor Radó in 1962, the Busy Beaver function is a classic example of a noncomputable function. Moreover, it has been the focus of my research for the preceding months. In particular, I focus my work towards the study of Turing machine deciders, algorithms that attempt to determine whether or not a Turing machine will halt.
