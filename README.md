Hi, I'm Autumn, an independent researcher working with computability and proof theory. The focus of my research is on automated Turing machine deciders for the Busy Beaver function and ordinal analysis of the Busy Beaver function. 

Documentation of my work on the Busy Beaver function can be found [here](https://wiki.bbchallenge.org/wiki/User:Autumn-Pan)
## Works

## Current Projects
**BBChallenge:** I actively contribute to the Busy Beaver Challenge, primarily focusing on writing deciders and writing documentation. 
**Retrograde Analysis of Turing Machines:** An extension of Backwards Reasoning using invariants (Mathematical results complete, Manuscript in progress)
